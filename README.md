# Glimpse Image Editor

Glimpse is a downstream fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10. You can find out more information on our FAQs page: https://glimpse-editor.org/about/

## What is different about Glimpse?
Aside from the rebrand that provides excellent free software with a less problematic name, we also focus on performance improvements, user interface changes and incrementally improving the user experience.

In the longer term we intend to write our own GUI and plug-in framework on top of the [GEGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEGL) component maintained by the same developers, but it will likely take years for those aspirations to be fully realised.

## How will the package versions work?
Glimpse 0.x releases are based on GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10 and are intended to provide a minimum viable product. They also help us build our project infrastructure, learn the codebase and iterate towards a fully supportable product.

You can see how this effort is going in the [dev-g210](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/tree/dev-g210) branch.

Glimpse 1.x releases will also be based on GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10, but these will be provided with technical documentation, lesson plans, and a long term support period.

Glimpse 2.x releases will utilise a new GUI that follows the [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/) and our own leaner plug-in framework.

We do not work to fixed timelines. Instead we select a month we want to aim for, and if the release needs more time then we update our schedule accordingly.

## How can I keep up to date with Glimpse's progress?
Our official project website is now live (but still under construction) at https://glimpse-editor.org.

You can also follow us on the fediverse at [@glimpse@bobadon.co.uk](https://bobadon.co.uk/@glimpse)
or on Twitter at https://twitter.com/glimpse_editor.

## How can I build Glimpse?
All of the build instructions can be found on [the Building Glimpse wiki](https://wiki.glimpse-editor.org/index.php?title=Building_Glimpse).

## How can I contribute?
Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/issues) page on Github and see where you can contribute. You can also join us [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/+glimpse:matrix.org) to provide us with feedback directly and participate in the decision-making process.

Alternatively you can help by spreading the word, writing a blog post about us or providing new artwork.

You can also donate to this project and follow it via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/glimpse). If you can afford to do so we also encourage you to donate to [GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/donating/) as that helps the upstream project we rely on.
